A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images
A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images. This repo consist of our project which was done under the guidance of IBM-Nalaiya Thiran Scheme.

The goal of this project is to help the doctors in operation theatres or a sterile environment where physical contact between persons should be avoided in order to be sterilized and also prevent from any infections.

Here, We train a CNN based model to recognize the hand gesture. The training data include images that captures the hand gestures of 1,2,3,4,5 and 0. The image is resized without much loss of information and used for training a CNN based model. 
We use Python Flask to provide an interactive platform for out model.
